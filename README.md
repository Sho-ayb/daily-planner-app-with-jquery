# Introduction

Our task is to build a work day scheduler application which should include 
the following: 

- The work day scheduler will be a browser based application. 
- When the user opens the app within the browser, they will be greeted with 
the main title "Word Day Scheduler" including a description and most 
importantly the current date - that should be in real time. 
- The schedule app itself allows the user to save a schedule description 
within a text area for each time of the day - starting from 9 am till 5 pm, 
as these are chosen as the times for a typical working day. 
- These schedule descriptions should remain persistent in the app even when 
the user refreshes the webpage.
